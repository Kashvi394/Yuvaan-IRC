# Yuvaan â€“ Extraterrestrial Mars Rover

**International Rover Challenge 2025 Finalist | Robotics Club, IIT Guwahati**

## Overview
Yuvaan is a Mars rover designed for the International Rover Challenge (IRC) 2025. Built by a multidisciplinary team from IIT Guwahati, it features capabilities for object retrieval, transport, and maintenance tasks through a robotic arm, along with soil sample collection and analysis via an integrated astrobiology testing module. 
## Key Features
- **5-DoF Robotic Arm** with worm gearboxes and precision-controlled gripper
- **Custom Modular Chassis** designed for easy assembly and weight optimization
- **Fusion 360 and Rhino-based CAD Models**, validated using static stress simulations
- **Sensor Integration** for terrain awareness and feedback control
- **Control Interface** built using ROS and Gazebo simulation environments

## My Role
As part of the Mechanical Subsystem:
- **Designed a custom two-fingered gripper** using Fusion 360, tailored for precise object manipulation and compatible with the rover's end-effector. The design includes considerations for object geometry and surface grip.
- **Modeled custom wheels** using Rhino, incorporating a Voronoi mesh pattern for strength-to-weight optimization.
- **Conducted static stress analysis** on critical components to ensure real-world load endurance.
- Contributed to mechanical documentation and design iteration reports.
